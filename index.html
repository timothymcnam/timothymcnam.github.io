                     <p> I am currently a sophomore computer science student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am on track to graduate in May of 2019 with a BS in Computer Science, along with a Math minor.  My current GPA is a <b>3.92</b>, I am on the Dean's list, and a member of the Commonwealth Honors College. My main focus will be in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Data Science.  However, I do take interest in different areas such as Network Security, and am always open to learn new things.</p>

                     <p> At this event, I worked alongside other programmers, with the use of GitHub, to build a song generator.  The overall product has a GUI to input a song name, which is then used to scan a text file for related lyrics. These lines are then used to build a markov chain, capable of generating unique song lyrics related to the title of your song! With the use of a sorting algorithm, lines in the song are then rearranged to rhyme. O(nlogn) time, in case you were wondering. Then the final song is returned to the GUI for any user to enjoy. Currently, we have the program set to generate rap songs; however, by editing the text file, it is possible to generate any type of song! The possibilities are endless.</p>

                     <p> This is the computer science class I performed exceptionally well in at UMass and now TA for. While in this class we built the following programs from scratch, in scala, along with many others. The first is Data Wrangling. This project consisted of creating functions to filter and process data, in order to return various useful outputs. The next project is a sudoku board solver. For this, we parsed a sudoku board from an input string, and then recursively eliminated impossible moves until the board was solved. Lastly, one final project from this class was writing various regular expressions to detect different patterns in strings. For example, we made these for phone numbers, roman numerals, dates(accounting for the number of days in each month and leap years), and many more.</p>

                     <p> This is another computer science class I took and performed exceptionally well in at UMass. The emphasis of this class was to learn about the different data structures, and how they could be utilized to perform operations very efficiently. We also did a good amount of Java programming in addition to this. This included coding sorting algorithms and data structures that we then used to solve various problems in an efficient manner.  Some of the sorting algorithms include merge, quick, insertion, and heap sort; while the data structures include linked lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, self-balancing binary trees, and hash tables. One cool project that stuck out to me in this class is when I coded depth and breadth first search algorithms.  Although building these algorithms was interesting, the exciting part is that it was very easy to implement these search algorithms to solve almost-any problem. In my case, I used them to solve mazes and various other puzzles.</p>

                     <p> As a member of the Walpole Robotics team, I took on various projects. A few of the many tasks consisted of designing robotic mechanisms, building drive trains, wiring motors, and creating aesthetic panes. The Engineering Design Process was strongly emphasized and used to create our robot from scratch. Although these miscellaneous tasks were far from trivial, my biggest accomplishment is the scouting app I designed, and then led a team to build. This app was extensively used in competition to collect data on other robots. This data was then sent to a server where it was processed and used to form strategies for upcoming games. I then received feedback and worked with users to eliminate bugs and make other general improvements.</p>
